# Teashop-Analysis
This is miniproject just to practise datascience  and pandas library, With that i made a graphical representation in this project

Every Solution Raises From the problem Likewise This Project is based on the problem of the client whos is planning to Open a Tea Shop.This project TheTeaShop Analysis is used to analyze the previous year sales report and city population report to give a detailed analysis to the client Bases on the Questions of the client this project is designed in a way to solve the problems of the client. This Project Uses some Certain Algorithms to predicit the values of the analysis Mainly it Uses Linear regression Algorithm to predicit the values of this project Even through some alternate tools are there to attain the result of this project This project can process thousands of dataset into the project and can process the results at fraction of seconds.

**Client Problems**
1. What is the best place for a tea shop in Tamilnadu
2. Where we can open a branches & sub branches
3. What is the Best Time to sell a Tea ? 
4. Predict the sales of tomorrow by using todayâ€™s report

After analysing all the client problems,I represent answers for the client by graphically using data science
