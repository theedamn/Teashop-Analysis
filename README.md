# The TeaShop Analysis

The TeaShop Analysis is a mini-project that utilizes the pandas library and data science techniques to analyze the sales and population data for opening a tea shop. The project aims to provide insights and solutions to the client's questions and problems related to opening a tea shop.
## Project Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas 
- numpy 
- seaborn 

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Make sure you have Python3 installed on your system before installing the dependencies.

Note: It's recommended to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate the dependencies. You can use tools like virtualenv or conda to create a virtual environment.

Once you have installed the dependencies, you are ready to run the project.
## Project Overview

The project consists of the following key components:

- Data Collection: Gathering and collecting the sales report and city population data from reliable sources.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, data formatting, and data transformation.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. This includes visualizing the data using various graphs and charts.

- Machine Learning: Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict sales and provide insights on the best place, branches, sub-branches, and the best time to sell tea.

- Data Visualization: Presenting the analysis results and insights using graphical representations such as bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
## Client Problems and Solutions

1. Best Place for a Tea Shop: By analyzing the city population data, the project determines the locations with high population density and identifies the best place to open a tea shop in Tamil Nadu.

2. Branch and Sub-Branch Recommendations: Using clustering techniques or geographic analysis, the project suggests optimal locations for opening branches and sub-branches based on customer density and proximity to the main tea shop.

3. Best Time to Sell Tea: By analyzing the sales data, the project identifies the peak hours or specific time periods when tea sales are highest, helping the client optimize their business operations.

4. Sales Prediction: Using linear regression, the project predicts the sales for the next day based on the current sales report, providing the client with insights on expected sales and allowing them to plan inventory and resources accordingly.
## Data Science and Graphical Representation

The project leverages the power of data science techniques, including data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms, to analyze and solve the client's problems. The graphical representation of the analysis results using various charts and graphs enhances the understanding and visualization of the data.
## Conclusion

The TeaShop Analysis mini-project showcases the application of data science and pandas library to provide valuable insights and solutions for opening a tea shop. By addressing the client's questions and utilizing data-driven approaches, the project assists in making informed decisions regarding the best location, branch placement, optimal selling time, and sales predictions. The graphical representation of the analysis results further enhances the understanding and presentation of the findings.
